# 🧠 Python for Absolute Beginners

This guide covers the very basics of Python — what it is, how to run it, and core concepts before writing scripts.

---

## 💡 What is Python?

**Python** is a general-purpose, interpreted programming language known for its readable syntax. It's widely used for scripting, automation, data analysis, web development, and more.

It's:

- Easy to read and write
- Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS)
- Batteries included (huge standard library)
- Dominant language for sysadmin automation alongside Bash/PowerShell

---

## 📟 Running Python

```bash
# Check version
python3 --version

# Interactive REPL
python3

# Run a script
python3 myscript.py

# Run one-liner
python3 -c "print('Hello, World')"
```

In the REPL (`>>>`):
```python
>>> print("Hello!")
Hello!
>>> 2 + 2
4
>>> exit()
```

## 🔹 Basic Data Types

```python
# Integer
x = 42

# Float
y = 3.14

# String
name = "Alice"

# Boolean
active = True
disabled = False

# None (like null)
value = None

# Check type
print(type(x))    # <class 'int'>
```

---

## 🖨️ Printing Output

```python
print("Hello, World")
print("Name:", name)
print(f"Hello, {name}!")   # f-string (preferred)
```

---

## 💬 Comments

```python
# This is a single-line comment

"""
This is a
multi-line string, often used
as a docstring or block comment
"""
```

---

## 📥 User Input

```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")

# Input is always a string — convert if needed
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
```

| Float           | `y = 3.14`                |
| String          | `s = "hello"`             |
| Boolean         | `b = True`                |
| None            | `v = None`                |
| Print           | `print(f"Hello {name}")`  |
| Get input       | `x = input("Prompt: ")`   |
